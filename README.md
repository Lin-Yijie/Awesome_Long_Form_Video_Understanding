# Awesome Untrimmed Video Understanding
Real-world videos are usually long, untrimmed and contrain serveral actions (events). 

## Representation Learning
* Learning from Untrimmed Videos: Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning with Hierarchical Consistency
* Boundary-sensitive Pre-training for Temporal Localization in Videos
* TSP: Temporally-Sensitive Pretraining of Video Encoders for Localization Tasks

## Untrimmed Video Datasets

# TODO
- [ ] add dataset
- [ ] add pretraining, detection and grounding papers
- [ ] add a plot to illustrate differences between untrimmed videos and trimmed videos, and also between different localization tasks
